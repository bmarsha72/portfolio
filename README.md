# portfolio
Brian Marshall - This was a last minute substitute for my other portfolio page that had an issue with a
php email form when I loaded it onto the server.  It still has issues when I squeeze it.  The nav bar still will not
collapse into the top left when viewed on mobile devices like it is supposed to.  There are overlapping break point issues
to resolve on the home page.  There are some text overlap issues on the about page, but I ran out of time.
